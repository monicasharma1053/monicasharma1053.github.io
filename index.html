            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p> I joined this project in its infancy and worked with the team to refine the product vision up to the completed product. We entered a relatively new space because our customers would be taking out larger loans with added flexibility to there repayment schedules. I approached this from an Agile/Lean UX perspective. I performed stakeholder interviews and initial user reasearch to understand the needs and habits of our potential user base. I also created a competitive analysis of other products in a similar space to further refine the personas. This allowed me to stay ahead and assist the Creative and Development team. I worked in parallel with UI and Copy. We primarily used whiteboards, paper/pencil, and Indigo to prototype and visualize our ideas. Tree sorting and card sorting techniques were also implemented at various stages. I conducted usability testing throughout the prototype and development lifecycle. I also monitored the product post launch and collected live feedback to assist in further refining our MVP as the product developed.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Politburo was a feature that needed to be added to an internal application used by 1000+ call center employees. I was pulled in for assessing whether the feature was actually necessary and designing the experience to be cohesive with the rest of the application. I spent some time doing a bit of ethnographic research and shadowing call center representatives to understand how they use the application and the best approach for integrating this new component. I worked with the business team to refine the requirement specs and define what was necessary based on our observations and user interviews. I took an Agile/Lean UX approach and worked directly with the development team. I designed the wireframes with Justinmind and set up usability testing at various milestones.</p>

                <p>I took this project from a brainstorm into a completed functioning product. I took an Agile/Lean UX approach and began by defining assumptions with business stakeholders and identifying the biggest potential for risk. I created and distributed surveys among potential customers and then conducted initial user conversations and research to identify behaviors and motivations. I worked side by side with the Development team(Software Engineers, UI Engineers, QA,and Database), Product Manager, and Strategy and Operations. I developed the sitemap, created personas based on our initial user research, utilized card sorting techniques for the Registration process, and information architecture (tree-jack) for Account Home. UX stayed an iteration ahead of the development team to test live prototypes throughout the lifecycle. </p>

                <p>This was a project that I worked on for a non-profit through EPIC (Engaging Philanthropy Inspiring Creatives). I was the User Experience Designer amongst a team of 8 other creatives, developers, and a project manager. We redesigned the website for The HoneyComb Project and created a responsive wordpress site for them. I went through a couple of initial sessions with the client to determine there needs and requirements. I took an inventory of the current sitemap and removed unnecessary content as well as restrategized the current architecture through card-sorting with some of there potential members. I also created the wireframes and did usabiliy testing at various stages.</p>

                <p>In 2014, UK FCA regulatory changes led to significantly altering our registration process and resulted in a significant decline in potential customers. I was brought on as a consultant to redesign a portion of the registration process within the FCA guidelines. Currently, customers were applying for an amount and were getting declined if they didn't qualify for the specified amount. The proposed solution was to present the user with amounts that they did qualify for based on repayment frequency. I conducted user research with our call center and shadowed customers who didn't understand there options so we could better design for the anticipated behavior. I created the wireframes and conducted usability testing. </p>

                <p>I spoke at the Uncubed 2014 conference in Chicago. My presentation was titled UX is Not Just For the User. I went through an overview of what UX is and how the various fields are influenced by UX. I also went into the User Centric Process and how it's in the best interest of the entire team to understand it.</p>
